# Binary Analyzer - README

## Overview

The **Binary Analyzer** is a simple C++ tool designed to analyze Portable Executable (PE) files, which are commonly used in Windows applications. This program reads and parses the headers and sections of a PE file, allowing you to inspect and manipulate sections of the binary. 

This tool is useful for understanding the internal structure of a PE file, extracting and analyzing sections like `.text`, `.data`, `.rsrc`, and others. It can also be extended to support more advanced operations like modifying section data or saving the modified binary to a new file.

## What the Code Does

The code focuses on parsing and interacting with the core structures of a PE file. Specifically, it works with the following:

1. **DOS Header**:  
   The DOS Header is the first part of the PE file. It contains a magic number (`0x5A4D` or "MZ") that identifies it as a valid executable file in the DOS format. The program checks this header to verify that the file is a valid PE file.

2. **PE Header**:  
   This part of the file includes the PE signature (`0x00004550` or "PE\0\0") to confirm that the file follows the PE format. The PE Header also contains important metadata, such as the number of sections and additional information about the file's layout in memory.

3. **Section Header**:  
   Sections are the building blocks of a PE file, representing segments of the executable code, data, resources, and other components. The Section Header includes the section name, virtual size, RVA (Relative Virtual Address), and a pointer to the raw data stored in the file. Each section represents a specific piece of the binary, like the code, data, or resources.

4. **Parsing Process**:  
   - `parseHeaders()`: This function reads the DOS and PE headers to ensure that the file is valid. It then proceeds to read the section headers to find out more about the sections contained within the PE file.
   - `parseSections()`: After gathering the headers, this function reads the individual sections based on the section headers and stores them in a list for easy access.
   - `getSection()`: This function allows you to retrieve a specific section by its name, so you can access the raw data or analyze the section further.
   - `save()`: Once the sections are parsed, this function saves the section data to a new output file. This can be useful for extracting or manipulating parts of the binary.

## How the Code Works

1. **Opening the File**:  
   The program opens the PE file in binary mode for reading and begins by parsing the DOS header. If the magic number is valid (`0x5A4D`), it continues to parse the PE header.

2. **Validating the PE Format**:  
   After confirming the DOS header, the code checks the PE signature to ensure that the file is indeed a PE file. If the signature is valid (`0x00004550`), it proceeds to analyze the sections.

3. **Reading Section Headers**:  
   The program reads the section headers, extracting the names, sizes, and pointers to the raw data. It then reads the section data and stores it in a vector of `Section` objects for further use.

4. **Accessing and Saving Data**:  
   You can access the sections by name using the `getSection()` function. This allows you to work with a specific section's data directly. You can also save the section data to a new file with the `save()` function.

## Major functions

1. **Access Specific Sections**:  
   To access a specific section, you can call `getSection()` with the name of the section you're interested in:

   ```cpp
   Section textSection = analyzer.getSection(".text");
   std::cout << "Text section size: " << textSection.data.size() << " bytes." << std::endl;
   ```

2. **Save Section Data**:  
   To save the section data into a new file, use the `save()` function:

   ```cpp
   analyzer.save("output.exe");
   ```

## What's Next?

There are a few ways i will do for extending this tool:

- **Support for More Section Types**: The code currently works with the basic sections in a PE file. I will extend it to handle more advanced section types (like `.reloc`, `.debug`, or `.rsrc`).
  
- **Modify Section Data**: I could modify the section data (e.g., apply obfuscation or patching) and then save the modified file.

- **Error Handling**: The current error handling is basic.
